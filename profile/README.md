# 🟣 DAS Foundation  
### Empowering People to Own Their Lives

The **DAS Foundation** stewards the **DAS Ecosystem** — a network of blockchain, education, and community platforms that help people achieve time, health, and financial freedom.

We build **DAS Chain**, a sovereign blockchain (Cosmos SDK + CometBFT, IBC-ready) and the native token **DST** (base denom **udst**) to power transparent rewards, marketplaces, and governance.
